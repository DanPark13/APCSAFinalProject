Design the software for an Amusement Park using Eclipse.

Step 1:  Determine the Attraction class, a parent class for an amusement park attraction. It includes such data members as maximum number of riders, cost of tickets, number of tickets to use, number of attendants, cost of utilities, length of ride, riders per hour, hours per day, speed, height, etc.

Step 2:  Create a client program (main class) and test methods for calculations such as daily cost, profit, etc. 

Step 3:  Each student member creates a specific attraction of their own that inherits the agreed-upon data members of the parent class. Each student makes a class that has an is-a relationship to the Attraction class.   Attraction must be approved before creating the class.
For example:  a FerrisWheel class , a Merry_Go_Round class, a RollerCoaster class. Each inherits the basic Attraction class, plus has its own unique data members and methods. Interesting data members might include speed, number of turns and other factors, depending upon the attraction. Methods unique to the child class include calculating g-force, "puke factors," and daily profit. 

Step 4:  Present your project to the class, describing your attraction and how it works.
